This is a simple template for a bevy project.

## Project structure

This assumes a single executable without a workspace. The Mise file
can be updated to accomodate a workspace workflow if desired. Note that
`bevy_simple_subsecond_system` does _not_ work with workspaces.

## System deps

- UNIX-like environment (I use Manjaro Linux)
- [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev)

Call `mise run` to see a list of all the available commands.
